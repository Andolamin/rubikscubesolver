# Ether Cube

Ether Cube is an interactive visualization of a Rubik's cube puzzle. Users can view and interact with a fully functioning model of a Rubik's cube. Next up on the project roadmap is to enable users to store ethereum in a Rubik's puzzle and send it to their friends. Their friends can then only access the ETH once they have solved the cube!

The project was a fascinating exploration of 3D visualization, data modelling, interface design and algorithms.
